All thermal datasets are spectrally harmonised using a single algorithm to retrieve LST. The data is delivered as if it were coming from a single satellite constellation. The geometry is aligned in all images: all images of a given AOI will show a perfect pixel alignment, regardless of the source. Each pixel holds a temperature value. Temperatures are presented in Kelvin degrees. Pixels that do not contain temperature values hold a \u2018nodata\u2019 value. Some zones may show empty pixels in several or all images, due to issues in the data processing from the public providers.
