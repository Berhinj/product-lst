Our technology delivers the market's most accurate and dependable thermal data, and specifically land surface temperature (ST). ST is not measured from space but determined using the best of Constellr\u2019s acquisitions of thermal, visible, and near infra-red data.\u00a0</p> <p>Our space journey begins with the deployment of the High-precision Versatile Ecosphere (HiVE) monitoring constellation. HiVE is equipped with a Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) imager, providing observations at a native spatial resolution of 30 meters, and a Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) imager, capturing details at a resolution of 10 meters, with a precision level of 2.0 K.\u00a0</p> <p>HiVE will operate in a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of approximately 500 km, marking a crucial step in our Earth Observation Thermal revolution. The two payloads on HiVE are thus:</p> <ol> <li> <p>One thermal infrared cryocool MCT sensor capturing imagery in 4 bands ranging from 8,5 \u00b5m to 11,5 \u00b5m in the LWIR part electromagnetic spectrum.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>One Visible and Near Infrared camera imaging on 11 spectral bands in the 400 to 980 nm range, the bands are aligned to Sentinel-2.\u00a0</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"#what-is-thermal-data","title":"What is thermal data ?","text":"<p>Thermal imaging provides valuable insights into temperature patterns and heat-related phenomena by utilizing the \"thermal infrared\" part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes 3-5 \u03bcm (Mid-wave) and 8-14 \u03bcm (Long-wave) portions of this spectrum. Constellr captures long-wave thermal data emitted by objects on the Earth\u2019s surface. The good news is that any object or material with a temperature above absolute zero (0 Kelvin or -273.15\u00b0C) will emit some thermal radiation in the form of infrared waves. Operating in the infrared region allows for the measurement of Earth's temperature. Unlike local sensors, which are limited to specific locations, spaceborne thermal imagery provides continuous temperature information across larger areas and in an integrated manner. This capability enables us to monitor temperature changes and trends over time and space for various applications, such as assessing plant health earlier than traditional methods.</p> <ul> <li> <p> Sample Dataset</p> <p>Get access to free samples.</p> </li> <li> <p> Use Cases</p> <p>Explore the numerous applications of thermal imaging (available soon).</p> </li> <li> <p> Product Portfolio</p> <p>Explore our product portfolio.</p> </li> <li> <p> Learning Center</p> <p>Explore our educational content (available soon).</p> </li> <li> <p> Data Delivery and API</p> <p>(available soon).</p> </li> <li> <p> FAQ</p> <p>Description for help (available soon).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#media-socials-press","title":"Media / Socials / Press","text":"<p>Follow us on: Linkedin</p> <p>Explore: constellr.com</p> <p>Read about us: Forbes</p> <p>Contact Us Here</p>"},{"location":"DTC/","title":"Constellr DTC","text":"<p>Constellr-DTC provides hourly Land Surface temperature data at 30-meter resolution. </p> <p>Please note that this tool is still under development, and further improvements are expected soon.</p>"},{"location":"DTC/#overall-objectives","title":"Overall Objectives","text":"<p>The goal is to model the daily fluctuation in Land Surface Temperature (LST) at the highest spatial resolution possible.
