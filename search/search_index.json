It provides a standardized way to query and retrieve metadata and assets, making it suitable for automated workflows and integration with other tools. It naturally extends a static STAC catalogue to allow for dynamic search based on additional filters. In contrast, a web application is more user-friendly for interactive browsing, visualizing, and manually selecting data products.
