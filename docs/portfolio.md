# Introduction

## Why is monitoring temperature so important ?
Companies and institutions in industry and agriculture are in dire need of sustainable solutions to save freshwater, comprehend urban infrastructure, and enhance supply chain efficiency.
Consider temperature as a critical proxy for agriculture and infrastructure. It plays a key role in guiding decisions related to, for example, urban planning, heat management or irrigation practices. By consistently and reliably monitoring temperature over time, we can gather valuable insights, painting a clearer picture than a single data point ever could. The advantages of temperature monitoring ripple out to numerous areas, impacting livelihood, health, food production, consumption, and essential survival needs.
