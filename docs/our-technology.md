Constellr is at the forefront of precise thermal monitoring from space. Our technology delivers the market's most accurate and dependable thermal data, and specifically land surface temperature (ST). ST is not measured from space but determined using the best of constellr's acquisitions of thermal, visible, and near infra-red data. 

Precision farming and other use cases, demand highly accurate data, such as a stable observation time (like 10 AM) and temperature readings with a precision of 2K. To meet these needs, we’re launching a  constellation of satellites equipped with advanced imaging technology.

The satellites feature a Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) imager, which captures temperature readings at the field level with a 30-meter resolution. This allows us to monitor the temperature of specific areas with great detail.
Paired with the LWIR is a Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) imager, which not only provides crucial data to support accurate temperature measurements but also helps us identify field boundaries and locate specific areas within those fields. Together, these tools ensure that farmers get the precise, reliable data they need to optimize their operations.

Our space journey begins with the deployment of the High-precision Versatile Ecosphere (HiVE) monitoring satellite constellation. HiVE is equipped with a Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) imager, providing observations at a native spatial resolution of 30 meters, and a Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) imager, capturing details at a resolution of 10 meters, with a precision level of 2.0 K. 

HiVE will operate in a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of approximately 500 km, marking a crucial step in our Earth Observation Thermal revolution. The two payloads on HiVE are thus 
one thermal infrared cryocool MCT sensor capturing imagery in 4 bands ranging from 8,5 µm to 11,5µm in the LWIR part electromagnetic spectrum. 
One Visible and Near Infrared camera imaging on 11 spectral bands in the 400 to 980 nm range, the bands are aligned to Sentinel-2.
